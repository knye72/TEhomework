whiteboarding practice

take a method that returns bool. named strictlyIncreasing. take in int [] as param. true if values are strictly incresing. false otherwise.


// did this one wrong. it would just return true if the 2nd number was bigger than the 1st. 

public bool strictlyIncreasing(int[] arrayName)
int numberInQuestion = 0
{ for(int i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++)
    if(arrayName[i] > numberInQuestion)
    { numberInQuestion = arrayName[i]
        return true;
    }
    else return false;


create a method that returns an int[]. name it makeEnds. takes in an int[] called nums as a parameter. 
nums will always be length of 1+. 
return a new array of length 2, which contains the first and last element from nums. 

public int[] makeEnds(int[] nums)
{
    int[2] results = int[2]
    return results[] {nums[0], nums[^1]}
}
